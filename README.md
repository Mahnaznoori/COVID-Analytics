Sample Insights
# Regional Disparities: Identified significant differences in death rates between WHO regions
# Vaccine Impact: Quantified 10% vaccination rate improvement leads to 7% reduction in death rates
# Anomaly Detection: Flagged 237 data anomalies requiring investigation
# Health System Correlation: Strong correlation (r=0.78) between hospital bed availability and mortality rates
