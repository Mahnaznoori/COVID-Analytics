Aegis-Public-Health

An end-to-end system for analyzing the impact of vaccination on mortality using COVID-19 and World Bank data. Features include statistical validation, advanced time-series modeling (SARIMAX/VAR), a governance layer for auditability, and an interactive dashboard for policy simulation.

README.md Comprehensive COVID-19 Data Analysis System Multi-layer Framework for Assessing Vaccination Impact on COVID-19 Mortality Across WHO Regions

Overview This repository contains a comprehensive multi-layer COVID-19 data analysis system designed to integrate epidemiological indicators with World Bank development indicators, in order to evaluate the impact of vaccination on mortality rates across different WHO regions. The system follows a structured end-to-end pipeline including: • Automated multi-source data collection • Robust preprocessing & regional aggregation • Statistical validation & model selection • Advanced time-series modeling with governance controls • Interactive policy simulation dashboard

 Key Objectives • Quantify the relationship between vaccination rates and mortality trends • Identify optimal lag times between vaccination rollout and mortality impact • Compare patterns across WHO regions • Ensure reproducibility using a structured pipeline and strong governance layer

Key Features Automated data acquisition from: • COVID-19 repositories (Google / official sources) • World Bank APIs (multi-year socioeconomic and development indicators)  Data processing & validation: • Cleaning, missing value handling, outlier treatment • Regional aggregation across WHO regions • Vaccination start-date estimation per region/country Advanced statistical modeling: • SARIMAX (seasonality & exogenous variables) • VAR / VECM (multivariate modeling and causality patterns) • Statistical tests for stationarity, normality, and model selection Governance & audit layer: • Decision logs and rationale • Validation certificates • Anomaly detection reports • Audit trails for reproducibility and traceability  Interactive dashboard: • Region selection • Policy simulation (+50% / −20% vaccination change) • Lag adjustment (0–120 days) • Real-time visual interpretation of outcomes

Output Files & Reports Generated artifacts are automatically organized under: • outputs/plots/ → time-series and model diagnostics • outputs/csv/ → tabular results per region and model • outputs/json/ → structured model results • outputs/reports/ → detailed analytical reports • outputs/pdf/ → final PDF reports • governance/ → decision logs, anomaly reports, validation certificates

Dashboard Capabilities The dashboard supports: • Region selection (single region / all regions) • Lag time adjustment (0–120 days) • Policy simulation (vaccination change: −20% to +50%) • Anomaly detection • Visualization of vaccination vs mortality relationships

Models Implemented • SARIMAX: univariate and multivariate time-series with exogenous regressors • VAR: multivariate time-series modeling and response dependencies • VECM: cointegration-based modeling for long-term relationships

Data Sources This project uses public and licensed data sources such as: • COVID-19 repositories (e.g., Google, official datasets) • World Bank Open Data APIs Note: Raw full datasets are not included in this repository due to size and reproducibility policy. Only sample datasets or download scripts are provided.

Reproducibility Notes To ensure reproducibility: • Each layer checks for required input files before execution • Outputs are versioned and stored with consistent naming • Governance logs maintain audit trails for decisions and anomalies • Detailed logs are stored under the logs/ folder

Troubleshooting

Common Issues

    File Not Found • Ensure layers are executed sequentially • Confirm paths match your local project directory
    Memory Errors • Process in smaller chunks • Use a machine with more RAM
    API Timeouts • Retry mechanism exists • Run during off-peak hours
    Dashboard Not Loading • Verify previous layers completed successfully • Confirm dependencies installation
